# ARQ_RL
This project focuses on employing reinforcement learning in order to learn a good transmission scheme in place of standard Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) when taking delay into account.
In order to do so, we implement the transmission environments and some classical channel models, such as i.i.d. packet erasure channel, Gilbert-Elliott and Fritchman's Channels. The project is a part of my research in streaming.
